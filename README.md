### Hello there, kind internet stranger!

Here are some things about me:  

- I have a Computer Science undergraduate degree from [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br/).
- I currently work at [VirtualiSurg](https://virtualisurg.com/) as a DevOps Engineer, managing GitHub and GitLab CI-CD pipelines, mantaining runners, and automating development processes in the company.
- I really like working with server infrastructure, Kubernetes, and am interested in Site Reliability Engineering.
- You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](https://lerenner.dev/cv.pdf).

<br/>

I have worked on many projects over the years, and many of them are documented here on github! Some honorable mentions include:

- A home server that runs my [personal kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/LeRenner/pudimnetes) with over 20 deployments of small web projects, self-hosted infrastructure, and websites my friends made
- A [RTL-SDR based web radio](https://pudim.xyz/radio/) that transmits real-time tower communications from Congonhas Airport (CGH)
- A [decentralized messaging application](https://linux.ime.usp.br/~renner/MAC0499/) with a hybrid Tor/P2P architecture as a Capstone Project for my Computer Science degree
- [Homemade smart lights](https://github.com/LeRenner/pudimLights) that can be controlled by anyone with an invite
- An [MQTT-based telegram messenger](https://github.com/LeRenner/telegram-mqtt-messenger), for easy notifications from IOT devices on my home network
- An [anonymous messaging website](https://github.com/LeRenner/pudim-mailer) integrated to my personal Telegram bot that allows anyone to send me anonymous messages
